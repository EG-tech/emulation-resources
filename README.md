# emulation-resources
A collection of resources re: emulation for preservation and access. Maintained by myself for [personal](https://ethan-gates.com/talks/2018-02-20-talk-5) and [professional](https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/emulation-as-a-service-infrastructure) reasons, but pull requests welcome!

If you have never contributed to GitLab before, feel free to [file a new issue](https://gitlab.com/EG-tech/emulation-resources/issues) with a link and I'll add it! Or just ping me [elsewhere](https://digipres.club/@The_BFOOL).

There is a related companion repository for disk imaging resources at [disk-imaging-resources](https://gitlab.com/EG-tech/disk-imaging-resources)

## Hobby Sites and Computer History Resources
I've received many questions about where I get information about using and configuring old operating systems (and troubleshooting them with various emulation applications). Short answer: wherever search engines take me, even if it's a random forum post from 2004. But there are some vintage computing hobbyist sites and resources that have popped up more often, so a shoutout to those here:

I should also mention that the Internet Archive frequently has scanned manuals, magazines and self-help books that you can download or check out from their [eBook library](https://archive.org/details/texts)!

## Emulators Written in JavaScript

Many of the emulators listed above and more have been ported to [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), enabling them to be hosted and embedded on web pages and run by a browser. This is, for instance, how Internet Archive does their in-browser console and early PC emulation (e.g. with Em-DOSBox, a JS port of DOSBox, and JSMESS, a JS port of MAME/MESS).

JavaScript emulation has many advantages, especially that it makes emulated computers widely and quickly shareable. However, it passes much of the computing load on to client browsers - the entire emulator application, plus whatever operating system and applications or files the user wants to view, have to get downloaded into the user's browser. So it makes a lot of sense for early systems that barely take up much storage space or computing power by modern standards, but trying to run anything from ~2000 on (e.g. Windows XP and up) or the size of a CD-ROM runs the risk of unexpected/slow behavior, crashing the browser or client system, etc.

There are A LOT of emulators written in JavaScript, and I have found an already-existing list organized very similar to my own, so instead of recreating that work I will just link it here:

 - [Emulators written in Javascript](https://github.com/fcambus/jsemu), by @fcampbus on GitHub


## Hardware Emulators
[Hardware emulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_emulation) refers to the process of imitating one piece of hardware with another piece of hardware. Its utility is a little unclear in preservation and archiving use cases - part of the advantage of software emulation is the portability and flexibility of working in virtual environments.

Hardware emulation projects are frequently pushed forward by retro-computing and gaming hobbyists who want, for example, to maintain and use legacy computers without relying on fragile and no-longer-produced digital media (i.e. floppy disks, CD-ROMs) or parts.

They're pretty neat though, so I thought I'd include them here.

## Bibliography
For some time, I maintained a bilbiography here of published resources related to emulation and software/digital preservation, including blog posts, journal articles, use cases, discussions of copyright consideration, training modules, and more. It ultimately grew to a point that GitLab/markdown was not a great place to keep adding to it.

I have instead moved those citations and resources to a [collection on my Zotero account](https://www.zotero.org/ethan-gates/collections/ERZIYJ3T). Going forward, I will add new resources I find there - do check it out, as that page now has everything I previously linked in this repo and more. (This bibliography has also been copied/mirrored to the Software Preservation Network's [public Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/software-preservation/library)); much thanks to the SPN Training & Education working group for accepting my contribution!)
